## Ingredients

- 400 g brioche loaf (or rolls)
- 150 g salted butter, melted
- 100 g soft brown sugar
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 500 ml milk
- 500 ml double cream
- 400 g dark chocolate (strong cocoa %)
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 egg yolks
- 50 ml milk
- 1 tbsp cocoa nibs (optional)
- 50 ml double cream (to drizzle)
- 12 mint leaves (garnish)

# Instructions

1. Take the brioche and cut them into cubes about 2-3cm on each side. Dunk them in a bowl of melted butter, then toss in a bowl that has the brown sugar and ground cinnamon combined.
2. Preheat an oven to 180Â°C. Arrange the tossed croutons on a clean non-stick baking tray and bake for 6-8 minutes until they are golden. (They will crisp up as they cool!)
3. Heat the milk and cream up in a large saucepan until almost boiling. Snap the chocolate int much smaller squares. Drop the chocolate into the warm milk/cream and stir until it all melts and becomes sensually smooth!
4. Stir the cocoa powder, cornflour and egg yolks together with a an extra splash of cold milk until it becomes a smooth paste. Spoon the paste into the hot soup as you whisk and it'll thicken within a minute or so.
5. Serve a ladle of soup in a warm bowl with croutons on top, a drizzle of extra cream, scattering of crunchy cocoa nibs and a few fresh mint leaves.
